Howdy. This is my personal GitHub account mostly reserved for the publication of personal-related works done on a crappy school chromebook.

I'm an experienced Canadian programmer with knowledge in mostly C#, Luau, and Python. I plan on pursuring a career to the likes of that, something related to Computer Science, or still to what I'm doing now; running a Ko-fi based on selling my works, same effect of what I mentioned previously.

This account will only be used occasionally, any activity solely based on views, stars, so and so is probably just out of procrastination or boredom.
